		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>
			Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. 
			On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature</em>, <em>New Scientist</em>, 
			and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, 
			was a well-thumbed copy of <em>On The Road</em>. 
			It had been Molly's favourite book since college, 
			and the longer she spent in these four walls, 
			the more she felt she needed to be free.
		</p>
		<p>
			She had spent the last ten years in this room, 
			sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that 
			<q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
			Although many considered her pioneering work, 
			unraveling the secrets of the llama <span title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</span>, 
			to be an outstanding achievement, 
			Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
